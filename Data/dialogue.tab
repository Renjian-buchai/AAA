WBwA17_f36161d2	a	Shut up.	game/siA.rpy	622	a "[what]"
WBwA17_088b7996	"Shopkeeper"	Fuck you, overwatch player.	game/siA.rpy	623	"Shopkeeper" "[what]"
WBwA17_cbfd794e		[a] glared at me.	game/siA.rpy	626	"[what]"
WBwA17_62d88b24	a	You didn't have to say that.	game/siA.rpy	627	a "[what]"
WBwA17_e289e092	u	Sorry, a CS:GO player like me can't understand having to be ashamed of doing what I like.	game/siA.rpy	628	u "[what]"
WBwA17_f36161d2_1	a	Shut up.	game/siA.rpy	631	a "[what]"
WBwA17_b54e4039	u	Haha.	game/siA.rpy	632	u "[what]"
WBwA17_28375e20	u	Well, we'll get the shiba inu plushie.	game/siA.rpy	633	u "[what]"
WBwA17_3e705b5d	"Shopkeeper"	A'ight, I'll bring it down.	game/siA.rpy	634	"Shopkeeper" "[what]"
WBwA17_e18bde62		He hoisted down the plushie before passing it over to me.	game/siA.rpy	638	"[what]"
WBwA17_a9310a57	"Shopkeeper"	Here's it.	game/siA.rpy	640	"Shopkeeper" "[what]"
WBwA17_ee15ba9f	u	Alright, thanks.	game/siA.rpy	641	u "[what]"
WBwA17_c518428f		I handed the plushie over to [a].	game/siA.rpy	642	"[what]"
WBwA17_c72b5e4f	a	Thanks!	game/siA.rpy	644	a "[what]"
WBwA17_ad7b006b	u	You're welcome.	game/siA.rpy	645	u "[what]"
WBwA17_ae62cc95	a	No, really, thank you.	game/siA.rpy	646	a "[what]"
WBwA17_93b929f3	u	What the fuck?	game/siA.rpy	647	u "[what]"
WBwA17_658267ce		I still can't understand women even after speaking to her for almost a year.	game/siA.rpy	648	"[what]"
WBwA17_502c2606		She's already thanked me once, hadn't she?	game/siA.rpy	649	"[what]"
WBwA17_829ecea7	u	Anyways, bye.	game/siA.rpy	650	u "[what]"
WBwA17_58fda28c	"Shopkeeper"	Bye.	game/siA.rpy	651	"Shopkeeper" "[what]"
WBwA17_f60d1f7a		We walked away from the stall.	game/siA.rpy	655	"[what]"
WBwA17_800066ac	u	Where should we go now?	game/siA.rpy	657	u "[what]"
WBwA17_839c2b43	a	I don't know.	game/siA.rpy	658	a "[what]"
WBwA17_e34b737c	u	Isn't there a competition going on at the competition stage?	game/siA.rpy	659	u "[what]"
WBwA17_dead97e3		I remember seeing it on a flyer on the way to the exhibition hall.	game/siA.rpy	660	"[what]"
WBwA17_f0d837d3	a	Huh? That sounds interesting.	game/siA.rpy	661	a "[what]"
WBwA17_17b1b47e	a	Let's go!	game/siA.rpy	662	a "[what]"
XBwA17_ed53d1b8	"Shopkeeper"	Your aim's great, boy.	game/siA.rpy	671	"Shopkeeper" "[what]"
XBwA17_7e01f4c9	u	Haha, I want the shiba inu plushie.	game/siA.rpy	672	u "[what]"
XBwA17_69cf4855	a	Hehe, your aim's better than I remember.	game/siA.rpy	673	a "[what]"
XBwA17_250e42da	u	Shut up.	game/siA.rpy	674	u "[what]"
XBwA17_9658ded8	u	It has always been this good.	game/siA.rpy	675	u "[what]"
XBwA17_b24ce5f8	u	I was just playing the pig to eat the tiger.	game/siA.rpy	676	u "[what]"
XBwA17_879cee34		That was a lie.	game/siA.rpy	677	"[what]"
XBwA17_a3c73fd3		It was just luck.	game/siA.rpy	678	"[what]"
XBwA17_6c3e8a98	a	No, you weren't.	game/siA.rpy	681	a "[what]"
XBwA17_85611e0e	a	Remember during our university's sports day, you were a part of the baseball team, and when you pitched, it became a homerun even before the batter hit the ball.	game/siA.rpy	682	a "[what]"
XBwA17_13f38696	u	Fuck, I just gave the other team a ball three times.	game/siA.rpy	683	u "[what]"
XBwA17_5bd0b95b		That is, I missed the strike zone thrice.	game/siA.rpy	684	"[what]"
XBwA17_be146545	a	What does that even mean?	game/siA.rpy	687	a "[what]"
XBwA17_5ee7365a		It was apparent that she didn't know the rules of baseball.	game/siA.rpy	688	"[what]"
XBwA17_22d64920		The shopkeeper laughed at our childish display, handing over the shiba inu plushie that he hoisted down.	game/siA.rpy	689	"[what]"
XBwA17_6a0074df		[a] recieved it, then hugged it tightly.	game/siA.rpy	692	"[what]"
XBwA17_89b16193	u	Alright, bye!	game/siA.rpy	693	u "[what]"
XBwA17_88c499ce	a	Bye!	game/siA.rpy	694	a "[what]"
XBwA17_3d04253e		The shopkeeper did not respond, just waving back.	game/siA.rpy	695	"[what]"
XBwA17_c6eef975		We left the game district.	game/siA.rpy	699	"[what]"
XBwA17_bb113f6a	u	Where do we go now?	game/siA.rpy	702	u "[what]"
XBwA17_33b775cb	a	Isn't there a competition going on at the competition stage?	game/siA.rpy	703	a "[what]"
XBwA17_4442a403	a	Why don't we go check it out?	game/siA.rpy	704	a "[what]"
XBwA17_b8911521	u	Alright.	game/siA.rpy	705	u "[what]"
BwA18_f1a2a825		There was a competition stage situated in the heart of the Christmas market.	game/siA.rpy	710	"[what]"
BwA18_95fa3177		Arriving at the competition stage, we suddenly realised that the area was quite empty.	game/siA.rpy	711	"[what]"
BwA18_cf047241	u	I think that we're too late.	game/siA.rpy	713	u "[what]"
BwA18_09db9eaf	a	Huh?	game/siA.rpy	715	a "[what]"
BwA18_83c1ae3b		I had noticed a sign posted on the stage.	game/siA.rpy	716	"[what]"
BwA18_e6ed1ce8		'Gift Wrapping competition concluded early as all prizes have been distributed.'	game/siA.rpy	717	"[what]"
BwA18_e745ce7c	a	Aww...	game/siA.rpy	720	a "[what]"
BwA18_7a29d628	a	The competition really sounded fun.	game/siA.rpy	721	a "[what]"
BwA18_80ff24c1	u	Not really.	game/siA.rpy	722	u "[what]"
BwA18_64ccd2a7		It actually, it sounds really lame.	game/siA.rpy	723	"[what]"
BwA18_2a4f8ffa	a	I'm actually great at gift wrapping.	game/siA.rpy	724	a "[what]"
BwA18_1e46651a	u	That's the real reason you find it fun, huh.	game/siA.rpy	725	u "[what]"
BwA18_ba71d0cf	a	Of course. If I can't win, what's the point?	game/siA.rpy	728	a "[what]"
BwA18_345b7ec6	u	How competitive.	game/siA.rpy	729	u "[what]"
BwA18_4b69512e	a	Well... then, what should we do now?	game/siA.rpy	732	a "[what]"
BwA18_d654ea6f	u	Dunno.	game/siA.rpy	733	u "[what]"
BwA18_92cee5c4		I noticed an empty bench near the stage.	game/siA.rpy	734	"[what]"
BwA18_cf574615	u	Why don't we sit there at the bench?	game/siA.rpy	735	u "[what]"
BwA18_8eea198e	a	Why? It's not like I sprained my ankle while walking in sandals.	game/siA.rpy	738	a "[what]"
BwA18_557bf5c6	u	Who wears sandals in this weather?	game/siA.rpy	739	u "[what]"
BwA18_c183e390	u	Regardless, you watch too many shows; you're thinking too deeply.	game/siA.rpy	740	u "[what]"
BwA18_c2e739c6	a	Why?	game/siA.rpy	743	a "[what]"
BwA18_37a8c160	a	Anime is fun to watch!	game/siA.rpy	744	a "[what]"
BwA18_a98aa40a	u	Hehe.	game/siA.rpy	745	u "[what]"
BwA18_e98d9276	a	What does that 'Hehe' mean?	game/siA.rpy	746	a "[what]"
BwA18_87d0b3e3	a	Are you judging me?	game/siA.rpy	749	a "[what]"
BwA18_6a0f0efb	u	No, of course not. I, too, watch anime occasionally.	game/siA.rpy	750	u "[what]"
BwA18_36463f94	a	Then you have no grounds to judge me.	game/siA.rpy	751	a "[what]"
BwA18_40f2aa4b	u	Didn't I just say that I wasn't judging you?	game/siA.rpy	752	u "[what]"
BwA18_78a1f012	a	Oh, right.	game/siA.rpy	753	a "[what]"
BwA18_d69958f9		The conversation up and died right there.	game/siA.rpy	756	"[what]"
BwA18_5228ae8e		I really can't understand girls' thoughts.	game/siA.rpy	757	"[what]"
BwA18_4943c792		How awkward...	game/siA.rpy	758	"[what]"
BwA19_664b4ece		We both sat at the bench in an awkward silence.	game/siA.rpy	762	"[what]"
BwA19_9c055ca7	a	There's a fireworks festival later.	game/siA.rpy	763	a "[what]"
BwA19_359e6af9	u	Oh, I guess?	game/siA.rpy	764	u "[what]"
BwA19_936219f4	u	There's nothing to pay for during some fireworks, right?	game/siA.rpy	765	u "[what]"
BwA19_63839766	u	So, can I go home?	game/siA.rpy	766	u "[what]"
BwA19_38281f03		[a] laughed.	game/siA.rpy	769	"[what]"
BwA19_f0e7b4e6	a	Of course not, you dumbass.	game/siA.rpy	770	a "[what]"
BwA19_55f70c48	u	Huh? But I need to do my holiday project.	game/siA.rpy	771	u "[what]"
BwA19_548d1dd2	a	Do you really not want a life?	game/siA.rpy	774	a "[what]"
BwA19_37d2f717	u	Of course not.	game/siA.rpy	775	u "[what]"
BwA19_6f7e8638	a	Do you not want to not have a life, or do you not want a life?	game/siA.rpy	776	a "[what]"
BwA19_d7c129b9	u	I don't want a life.	game/siA.rpy	777	u "[what]"
BwA19_ac6bea00	a	You idiot.	game/siA.rpy	778	a "[what]"
BwA19_e983fe90		She hit me in the shoulder playfully.	game/siA.rpy	781	"[what]"
BwA19_d8b96f4d		I really want to go home.	game/siA.rpy	782	"[what]"
BwA19_6124cd4c		The earlier incident aside, we sat in silence.	game/siA.rpy	785	"[what]"
BwA19_69b5c63d	a	Remember the first time we met?	game/siA.rpy	786	a "[what]"
BwA19_4226262c	u	The first time we met...	game/siA.rpy	787	u "[what]"
BwA19_fd2fbc93		The first time we met was at the university's library last year during the summer hols.	game/siA.rpy	788	"[what]"
BwA19_79223a87		Being the time of year that it was, it was mostly empty.	game/siA.rpy	790	"[what]"
BwA19_a4006017		At the time, [a] suddenly came up to me while I was reading for research purposes and writing an essay on the side.	game/siA.rpy	792	"[what]"
BwA20_773e85c3	a	What're you doing here?	game/siA.rpy	798	a "[what]"
BwA20_3af1faed	u	Is there anything that says I can't be here?	game/siA.rpy	799	u "[what]"
BwA20_897f6ad8	u	I could return the question to you, if so.	game/siA.rpy	800	u "[what]"
BwA20_d8a37648	a	Hmm... Good point.	game/siA.rpy	801	a "[what]"
BwA20_afed681d		She sat down opposite me.	game/siA.rpy	802	"[what]"
BwA20_720d9bb3	a	What're you reading?	game/siA.rpy	803	a "[what]"
BwA20_b8a027d3		I lifted up my book to reveal the cover.	game/siA.rpy	804	"[what]"
BwA20_0ca268ad		The laws of thought, by George Boole	game/siA.rpy	805	"[what]"
BwA20_d33d0fa9	a	Ew, philosophy.	game/siA.rpy	808	a "[what]"
BwA20_8b258704	u	Huh?	game/siA.rpy	809	u "[what]"
BwA20_1afd7521	u	Is that how you speak to everyone?	game/siA.rpy	810	u "[what]"
BwA20_1b9587c9		How rude.	game/siA.rpy	811	"[what]"
BwA20_a28802c0	a	No, but you're a philosophy student.	game/siA.rpy	814	a "[what]"
BwA20_2cf7ac56		Then, could it be because she doesn't like humanities students?	game/siA.rpy	815	"[what]"
BwA20_bca32007		She's pretty, but I never thought that she was a STEM student.	game/siA.rpy	816	"[what]"
BwA20_8a5e1381		Why would she be in an arts university if so, though?	game/siA.rpy	817	"[what]"
BwA20_703d7e97	u	I'm also a math student, so...	game/siA.rpy	818	u "[what]"
BwA20_547b62ea	a	Eww.	game/siA.rpy	821	a "[what]"
BwA20_0f28efe1		I can't understand what she's thinking.	game/siA.rpy	822	"[what]"
BwA20_ef2f1671	u	What?	game/siA.rpy	823	u "[what]"
BwA20_4d95b37f	a	Math is philosophy, right?	game/siA.rpy	824	a "[what]"
BwA20_563b9537	u	More or less, but why do you hate philosophy students?	game/siA.rpy	825	u "[what]"
BwA20_aa27cadb	a	I mean, if you're going to think about goodness or justice or knowledge, why don't you become a scientist or sociologist to learn more concrete facts?	game/siA.rpy	828	a "[what]"
BwA20_291657d0	u	Don't compare me to those bastard axiologists, metaphysists and epistemologists.	game/siA.rpy	829	u "[what]"
BwA20_6d58ba4e	u	I'm learning logic.	game/siA.rpy	830	u "[what]"
BwA20_587c2045	a	There are branches to philosophy?	game/siA.rpy	833	a "[what]"
BwA20_1b28a406	u	Of course.	game/siA.rpy	834	u "[what]"
BwA20_29266d4c	a	Either way, logicians can't be good anyways.	game/siA.rpy	837	a "[what]"
BwA20_6a016827	a	You'll probably preach to me about good arguments and whatnot.	game/siA.rpy	838	a "[what]"
BwA20_e85d5da8	u	Huh...	game/siA.rpy	839	u "[what]"
BwA20_20b767fc		This conversation's getting tiresome.	game/siA.rpy	840	"[what]"
BwA20_9857a417	a	Har?! You picking a fight?	game/siA.rpy	843	a "[what]"
BwA20_96ea63b8	u	No, I'm not picking a fight.	game/siA.rpy	844	u "[what]"
BwA20_facacaf5	u	Either way, I can't understand how you got a challenge declaration from my 'huh'.	game/siA.rpy	845	u "[what]"
BwA20_5b5464cf	a	You can't understand because you're an idiot for studying philosophy.	game/siA.rpy	848	a "[what]"
BwA20_8a3200cf	u	Well, then, what do you study?	game/siA.rpy	849	u "[what]"
BwA20_9eb79857	a	Acting, a much better degree than yours.	game/siA.rpy	852	a "[what]"
BwA20_c9b461ea	u	Oh, so you're a narcicist.	game/siA.rpy	853	u "[what]"
BwA20_b2d5f0b2	a	What did'ya just say?!	game/siA.rpy	856	a "[what]"
BwA20_91ef9546		Needless to mention, we started off on the worng foot.	game/siA.rpy	858	"[what]"
BwA20_dd2de578		Since then, she would come to the library every day just to insult me.	game/siA.rpy	860	"[what]"
BwA20_e596a707		I wasted my entire summer holidays because I couldn't study due to our diss wars.	game/siA.rpy	861	"[what]"
BwA21_4a116640	u	Of course I remember.	game/siA.rpy	866	u "[what]"
BwA21_d90d9c6d	a	Haha, do you remember how you called me every time we met?	game/siA.rpy	868	a "[what]"
BwA21_7b1c1392	u	...	game/siA.rpy	869	u "[what]"
BwA21_d7c3ea57	u	Nope.	game/siA.rpy	870	u "[what]"
BwA21_6cf4ac5b		I remember clearly.	game/siA.rpy	871	"[what]"
BwA21_44944711		It was 'Supporting Cast'.	game/siA.rpy	872	"[what]"
BwA21_812430cc		She got heated every time I called her that, and would constantly bug me to change it.	game/siA.rpy	873	"[what]"
BwA21_992e5057		Since she hated that form of address, it was only natural that I would continue to call her that.	game/siA.rpy	874	"[what]"
BwA21_a0221ae6	a	Haha.	game/siA.rpy	877	a "[what]"
BwA21_81c321a8		She doesn't seem to believe me.	game/siA.rpy	878	"[what]"
BwA21_a3cbae84	a	Is it so~?	game/siA.rpy	881	a "[what]"
BwA21_9ceece86		She definitely doesn't believe me.	game/siA.rpy	882	"[what]"
BwA21_a98aa40a	u	Hehe.	game/siA.rpy	883	u "[what]"
BwA21_76593aee	u	So, what's your point?	game/siA.rpy	884	u "[what]"
BwA21_f37bc33d	a	You know...	game/siA.rpy	887	a "[what]"
BwA21_4887b76e	a	We got quite close after insulting each other for a long time, right?	game/siA.rpy	888	a "[what]"
BwA21_f5fd8d1f	u	You don't say?	game/siA.rpy	889	u "[what]"
BwA21_c90a6ddf	u	Who'd have thought that we would now be going on (platonic) Christmas dates?	game/siA.rpy	890	u "[what]"
BwA21_088e0b4c		[a] blushed.	game/siA.rpy	893	"[what]"
BwA21_8dd46b20	a	Stop it.	game/siA.rpy	894	a "[what]"
BwA21_76c21148	u	You don't like me calling it that?	game/siA.rpy	895	u "[what]"
BwA21_af76c06f	a	Not really...	game/siA.rpy	896	a "[what]"
BwA21_59ca6a00	u	Oh.	game/siA.rpy	897	u "[what]"
BwA21_c5e0b9a3		Silence once again.	game/siA.rpy	898	"[what]"
BwA21_64150354	a	You know, I—	game/siA.rpy	899	a "[what]"
BwA22_6d78c3c8		She was interrupted by an announcement.	game/siA.rpy	903	"[what]"
BwA22_fdde0b4a	"Announcement"	The fireworks show is starting. Please do not approach the competition stage.	game/siA.rpy	904	"Announcement" "[what]"
BwA22_887ed415		[a] looked frustrated, but that was soon replaced by awe as a glowing trail snaked into the air.	game/siA.rpy	907	"[what]"
BwA22_a9f038a5	a	Beautiful.	game/siA.rpy	912	a "[what]"
BwA22_e8eb61b2	u	Yes, very beautiful.	game/siA.rpy	913	u "[what]"
BwA22_9f36b131		I was just responding randomly because I was wondering what she was planinng to say just now.	game/siA.rpy	914	"[what]"
BwA22_f578876b		My eyes didn't leave her face even as I spoke, something that [a] seemed to vaguely notice.	game/siA.rpy	915	"[what]"
BwA22_961c8571		Coloured slightly red, [a] turned to face me.	game/siA.rpy	918	"[what]"
BwA22_e6e258e3		She took a deep breath.	game/siA.rpy	919	"[what]"
BwA22_3480959b	a	You know, I really l-like you. Could you be my...	game/siA.rpy	920	a "[what]"

LBwA21_89714c80	u	If I recall correctly, it came from imperial China.	game/siA.rpy	1293	u "[what]"
LBwA21_b1ad144b	u	Then, banks would denote 500 taels of silver as a 'feng'.	game/siA.rpy	1294	u "[what]"
LBwA21_56343f19	u	So, 250 taels of silver would be half a 'feng'.	game/siA.rpy	1295	u "[what]"
LBwA21_1153f51c	u	Since 'feng' is also the pronunciation of 'crazy', 250 can also be said as half-crazy.	game/siA.rpy	1296	u "[what]"
LBwA21_af0521a6	a	Never knew that.	game/siA.rpy	1297	a "[what]"

LsxA19_26b9385e		Fuck.	game/siA.rpy	1815	"[what]"
LsxA19_468a7f2b		The shopkeeper exasperatedly took down the plushie, handing it over to me.	game/siA.rpy	1818	"[what]"
LsxA19_1e95fd68		I passed it over to [a].	game/siA.rpy	1819	"[what]"

LsxA19_1822e8e7	u	No need.	game/siA.rpy	1824	u "[what]"
LsxA19_a6f90c8f		We walked away from the booth.	game/siA.rpy	1826	"[what]"
LsxA19_eafd3210		It's late, so I want to go home.	game/siA.rpy	1827	"[what]"

LsxA19_b97309fc	a	No, there'st still a fireworks show.	game/siA.rpy	1834	a "[what]"
LsxA19_37035282	u	Oh, OK.	game/siA.rpy	1835	u "[what]"
LsxA19_69b320fd	u	There's no couple's discount during the fireworks show, so I can go home first, right?	game/siA.rpy	1838	u "[what]"

LsxA19_32625cd0	u	Should we find somewhere to sit and wait for the show to start?	game/siA.rpy	1845	u "[what]"
LsxA19_08e1d3d8	a	Oh, alright.	game/siA.rpy	1846	a "[what]"
LsxA19_acb5576b		We strolled around the market, looking for somewhere to sit.	game/siA.rpy	1849	"[what]"
LsxA19_0988b14e		[a] suddenly pointed at a park next to the market right as we passed by.	game/siA.rpy	1850	"[what]"
LsxA19_37035282_1	u	Oh, OK.	game/siA.rpy	1852	u "[what]"
sxA20_1fcc8b27		We sat at a bench in the park.	game/siA.rpy	1858	"[what]"
sxA20_d6340a14		It was much quieter compared to the bustle of the Christmas market.	game/siA.rpy	1859	"[what]"
sxA20_70975881	a	Right, eggnog!	game/siA.rpy	1862	a "[what]"
sxA20_b6eb2402		Her sudden exclaimation shocked me.	game/siA.rpy	1863	"[what]"
sxA20_7e4327db	u	Oh... you finally remembered?	game/siA.rpy	1864	u "[what]"
sxA20_be25a4ed		She really is an airhead.	game/siA.rpy	1865	"[what]"
sxA20_581e01fd	a	Yep, can you help me buy it?	game/siA.rpy	1868	a "[what]"
sxA20_ba9917af	a	Please?	game/siA.rpy	1869	a "[what]"
sxA20_cc53dae2	u	What about the couple's discount?	game/siA.rpy	1870	u "[what]"
sxA20_83743f7a	a	Lazy. Also, I can't buy anything while holding doge.	game/siA.rpy	1873	a "[what]"
sxA20_98cf8a70		Doge was probably the name she gave to the plushie.	game/siA.rpy	1874	"[what]"
sxA20_a0b76974	u	Alright...	game/siA.rpy	1875	u "[what]"
sxA20_435bf7ff		I reluctantly returned to the food section, bought two cups of eggnog, then headed towards the park.	game/siA.rpy	1878	"[what]"
sxA20_77c7d5a2		There seemed to be some kind of ruckus in the park.	game/siA.rpy	1879	"[what]"
sxA21_d4dfb8c8		I quickened my footsteps while trying not to spill the eggnog.	game/siA.rpy	1883	"[what]"
sxA21_dcd2cf9f		At the bench was [a] and another man.	game/siA.rpy	1885	"[what]"
sxA21_271bc131	"Man"	Why don't you come along with me?	game/siA.rpy	1888	"Man" "[what]"
sxA21_2969aef8	a	No, don't want to.	game/siA.rpy	1889	a "[what]"
sxA21_eca564f3	"Man"	Why not? Are you on a date?	game/siA.rpy	1890	"Man" "[what]"
sxA21_65b8aaa9	"Man"	Why don't you dump him and come with me?	game/siA.rpy	1891	"Man" "[what]"
sxA21_2585be66	a	I'm not on a date.	game/siA.rpy	1892	a "[what]"
sxA21_1f3b2856		She seemed to be very annoyed.	game/siA.rpy	1893	"[what]"
sxA21_918eced6	"Man"	Then there's no problem, right?	game/siA.rpy	1894	"Man" "[what]"
sxA21_fa58b851	a	There's definitely a problem, and that's that I don't want to go with you.	game/siA.rpy	1897	a "[what]"
sxA21_1190b335	"Man"	Why not?	game/siA.rpy	1898	"Man" "[what]"
sxA21_6f59e69c	"Man"	Come on, I'll show you something much better than your friend can.	game/siA.rpy	1899	"Man" "[what]"
sxA21_c6d440b6		The man grabbed onto her arm, pulling her with some strength.	game/siA.rpy	1900	"[what]"
sxA21_a41a7f11	a	Stop! Erm... Uhm... Help!	game/siA.rpy	1903	a "[what]"
sxA21_96f4b606		How amusing; she was so flustered she forgot how to say 'help'.	game/siA.rpy	1904	"[what]"
sxA21_f9d09ef4		Wait, that's not the point here.	game/siA.rpy	1905	"[what]"
sxA21_554dccb8		Finally, I have grounds to claim self-defense.	game/siA.rpy	1906	"[what]"
sxA21_7c1bce18	u	A'ight, that's enough.	game/siA.rpy	1907	u "[what]"
sxA21_da141089		Since his attention was completely on [a], his back was completely open.	game/siA.rpy	1908	"[what]"
sxA21_dc17be29		I kicked him diagonally in the ass, so that he fell onto the bench, then dumped a cup of piping hot eggnog onto his face.	game/siA.rpy	1910	"[what]"
sxA21_8d55e3b1	"Man"	What the fuck— Fuck you!	game/siA.rpy	1911	"Man" "[what]"
sxA21_bf759558		I held onto [a]'s hand, poured the other cup of eggnog onto his crotch (Since I can't run while holding it anyways), then ran away, pulling [a] along.	game/siA.rpy	1912	"[what]"
sxA21_5c933324	a	Finally, you acted.	game/siA.rpy	1915	a "[what]"
sxA21_c69f4a2c		She probably saw me while I was waiting for an excuse to kick him.	game/siA.rpy	1916	"[what]"
sxA21_fcd695f1	u	Sorry, the eggnog...	game/siA.rpy	1917	u "[what]"
sxA21_db342f9a	a	No need, at least I still have doge.	game/siA.rpy	1920	a "[what]"
sxA21_7b1c1392	u	...	game/siA.rpy	1921	u "[what]"
sxA21_c4a17b28	u	Well, let's go somewhere with more people.	game/siA.rpy	1922	u "[what]"
sxA21_b95dd80f	a	Haha!	game/siA.rpy	1925	a "[what]"
sxA21_f8b69f83	u	Why're you laughing?	game/siA.rpy	1926	u "[what]"
sxA21_125b3a2f	a	Well, it's fun.	game/siA.rpy	1927	a "[what]"
sxA21_3f03fc08		My face turned gloomy.	game/siA.rpy	1928	"[what]"
sxA21_762e40b6	u	Then I want to see whatever you don't think is fun.	game/siA.rpy	1929	u "[what]"
sxA21_66f3a9da	u	It must be like... hell, or something.	game/siA.rpy	1930	u "[what]"
sxA21_e35b9fc6	a	Hehe!	game/siA.rpy	1931	a "[what]"
sxA21_90926aca		We returned to the game district, which was the closest area to us.	game/siA.rpy	1934	"[what]"
sxA21_bc899a52	a	The fireworks show should happen in 5 minutes or so.	game/siA.rpy	1937	a "[what]"
sxA21_b592843e	u	And?	game/siA.rpy	1938	u "[what]"
sxA21_83bdc3c3	a	Dunno, just wanted to say it.	game/siA.rpy	1940	a "[what]"
sxA21_59ca6a00	u	Oh.	game/siA.rpy	1941	u "[what]"
sxA22_021fb58e		Soon, there was an announcement over the intercom system.	game/siA.rpy	1946	"[what]"
sxA22_93d09869	"Announcer"	The fireworks show is starting. For safety reasons, please do not approach the competition stage.	game/siA.rpy	1947	"Announcer" "[what]"
sxA22_d17781ee		Soon, there was a whistling sound as a glowing trail headed towards the heavens, followed by multiple others.	game/siA.rpy	1950	"[what]"
sxA22_033a3b5e		Immediately after, the fireworks exploded into a flower of sparks.	game/siA.rpy	1951	"[what]"
sxA22_302a9088		This was actually my first time seeing fireworks in person.	game/siA.rpy	1952	"[what]"
sxA22_cc60dc66		It looks much better than it does on TV.	game/siA.rpy	1953	"[what]"
sxA22_18940dbb	a	Wow, so beautiful!	game/siA.rpy	1956	a "[what]"
sxA22_10bd2be6	u	Yep, it's quite beautiful.	game/siA.rpy	1957	u "[what]"
sxA22_a3ba9638	a	Wait, why don't we record it?	game/siA.rpy	1958	a "[what]"
sxA22_a260ceb1	a	I want to share it on my lecture group chat.	game/siA.rpy	1959	a "[what]"
sxA22_75b30fb9	u	Good point.	game/siA.rpy	1960	u "[what]"
sxA22_d99d866f		I took out my phone.	game/siA.rpy	1961	"[what]"
sxA22_422f0990		The voice recorder was still on.	game/siA.rpy	1962	"[what]"
sxA22_fa3d4f68		I started the audio recording when that bastard tried to screw with [a].	game/siA.rpy	1963	"[what]"
sxA22_791ffc28		Just in case I need to submit it as evidence if he tried to sue us afterwards.	game/siA.rpy	1964	"[what]"
sxA22_aeb5639e		I stopped the recording, then opened the camera app, recording the fireworks.	game/siA.rpy	1965	"[what]"
sxA22_c9bfdc7b	a	You should watch the fireworks too, you know?	game/siA.rpy	1968	a "[what]"
sxA22_8c733ec5	a	Don't just look at it through the screen.	game/siA.rpy	1969	a "[what]"
sxA22_6aa4e2db	a	You can't get the full experience like that.	game/siA.rpy	1970	a "[what]"
sxA22_59ca6a00	u	Oh.	game/siA.rpy	1971	u "[what]"
sxA22_c2df58ed		The fireworks really were beautiful.	game/siA.rpy	1973	"[what]"
sxA23_249b0d25		After the fireworks show, the crowds dispersed and the stalls closed up for the day.	game/siA.rpy	1978	"[what]"
sxA23_f8510582	u	Should I walk you home?	game/siA.rpy	1981	u "[what]"
sxA23_bb5205df	u	It's really quite late.	game/siA.rpy	1982	u "[what]"
sxA23_9a47eaeb	a	Alright.	game/siA.rpy	1983	a "[what]"
sxA23_4dd578d7		I walked her home.	game/siA.rpy	1986	"[what]"
sxA23_f6005e9a		Her house was a little closer to the market than mine.	game/siA.rpy	1987	"[what]"
sxA23_19828c1c		We exchanged some banter along the way.	game/siA.rpy	1988	"[what]"
sxA23_7c36bb88		Finally, we arrived at her apartment.	game/siA.rpy	1989	"[what]"
sxA23_d43d5925		Standing in the fluorescent lightning of the apartment hallway, [a] turned around.	game/siA.rpy	1991	"[what]"
sxA23_141438e7	a	I had quite a lot of fun today.	game/siA.rpy	1993	a "[what]"
sxA23_145180e5	u	Me too.	game/siA.rpy	1994	u "[what]"
sxA23_67aaf1ae	a	I hope that we can do this next year, too.	game/siA.rpy	1995	a "[what]"
sxA23_2e11e504	u	Same.	game/siA.rpy	1996	u "[what]"
sxA23_f2e7d2e1		What she said was quite strange since we both have 2 more years in university, but I didn't think much of it.	game/siA.rpy	1997	"[what]"
sxA23_37e010ba	a	Then, goodbye.	game/siA.rpy	1998	a "[what]"
sxA23_a3aff06e	u	Goodbye.	game/siA.rpy	1999	u "[what]"
